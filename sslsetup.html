How to install an SSL from Godaddy on your Node.js server with Amazon Web Services Ubuntu 18.04
1. SSH into your server. (example: ssh –i nameofkey.pem ubuntu@111.11.11.11)
2. Type: Cd /etc/nginx/ssl (change directory here)
3. Type: openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout websitename.key -out websitename.csr (where websitename = name
or whatever you want the name to be)
4. Go through questions:
a. Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: US (for United States)
b. State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:CA (for California)
c. Locality Name (eg, city) []: Modesto (for City of Modesto)
d. Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]: Company, Inc
e. Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: websitename
f. Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: websitename.com
g. Email Address []: youremail@gmail.com
h. Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request: challenge password[]:
securepassword
5. Type: vim websitename.csr
6. Copy all inside data including the ----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST ----- and -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST -----, not
just the key inside.
7. Purchase an SSL certificate from Godaddy in this case.
8. Go to your products.
9. Click the plus next to SSL Certificates.
10. Click on Manage.
11. Enter in your CSR and validate the CSR.
12. Once CSR is validated and you are approved for HTTPS on YOUR website, Download the certificate by selecting Apache
as server type and then hitting the download button on the download page.
13. Get the files inside the zip file and move them into the destination of /etc/nginx/ssl (in this case I made a git
repository with the 2 files inside and and cloned the repository at this destination)
14. Once that’s complete you should have the .key, the .csr, and the 2 new files with a .crt extension
15. Rename the first one from the folder to websitename.com.crt and the second one to intermediate.com (where
websitename = your website name or name you want to use)
16. Type: sudo su, to become a super user so you can run the next command. (You can also do this next step locally
before pushing up to the server)
17. Run the command: cat websitename.com.crt intermediate.crt > websitename.com.chained.crt (this will create a single
chained certificate)
18. Type: cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
19. Type: vim name of file inside this folder such as website_name
20. Put the following inside this area:
a. Server {
listen 80 default_server;
listen [::]:80 default_server;
server_name;
return 301 https://$host$request_url;
}
(Note: This will redirect http requests to your https server)
21. Next put this:
a. server {
listen 443 ssl;
server_name websitename.com;
ssl on;
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/websitename.com.chained.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/websitename.key;
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';
location / {
proxy_pass http://{{PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS}}:{{SERVER_PORT}};
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
}
(Note: This will install the SSL certificate on your server.
22a. Type: sudo service nginx restart (restarts the nginx server and applies changes to the file you just made).
22b. If you get an error, run command given in error to check the error that occurred. Example, request_uri in 20a is
spelled request_url instead.. this will throw and error and the server will not start.. has to be perfect.
23. Check to see if your site is now using https:// and that http:// or websitename.com requests redirect to
https://websitename.com.
24. Lastly, make sure all links on your site (CDNs, etc) are https:// not http://, as no http:// links will work and
could result in features not working.
